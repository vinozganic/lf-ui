# Lost & Found: Reunite With Your Belongings 🔍

Welcome to the `lf-ui`, the frontend interface of Lost & Found, a centralized and automated platform aimed at quickly reuniting lost items with their rightful owners. As the visual and interactive component of Lost & Found, `lf-ui` provides a user-friendly and accessible way to report and search for lost items. In a world where the average person loses 9 items a year, and events can see hundreds to thousands of items lost, Lost & Found steps in as the modern solution to an age-old problem.
